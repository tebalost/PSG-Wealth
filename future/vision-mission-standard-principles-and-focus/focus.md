## Our Focus

{% hint style="info" %}
**Focus:** PSG Currently has multiple Mobile Apps that are managed by different teams/vendors and have a different look and feel and offer a different user experience. PSG needs one mobile app that will be a kind of marketplace of services and offerings, whether in-house or third-party ones, gathered under one umbrella.â€¯ "A PSG app would be closed ecosystem of many apps that users would use every day because it would offer a seamless, integrated, contextualized and efficient experience." &#x20;

Users will not have to switch between Apps to get all necessary information/assistance with regards to PSG and there is a need to build micro-services that will always render services to the mobile app and public facing website.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Main Focus

* [x] Ensure the Chat/Message us feature functions properly in that, when it's outside working hours, it must let visitors to leave their contact details for follow-up.
* [x] Eliminate the Google Forms that dominate all products and services by making user onboarding as automatic as possible.
* [x] Add the Play/App Store Icons with Links to redirect users to download an App for their devices.
* [x] Develop and automated product catalog that dynamically displays products based on user selection while wishing to proceed with an online/app application.
* [x] Ensure that standard pricing is visible upfront for some of the offering that have standard prices and enable users to choose and submit applications for these products and only confirm and activate the users.
* [x] Reduce/Eliminate the number of vendors for digital platforms or try to engage with one who delivers either web/mobile.&#x20;
